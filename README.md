# Challenge Overview 
In this challenge I worked with two data sets, one to analyze financial data and one to analyze election data. 

PyBank: Financial Data Analysis
    Using multiple for loops, I completed the following analysis on the data provided: 
        Calculated total months
        Calculated the average month-to-month revenue change 
        Calculated the greatest increase in profits 
        Calculated the greated decrease in profits 

PyPoll: Election Data Analysis 

    Using a for loop, I completed the following analysis on the data provided: 

        Calculated total votes 

        Calculated how many votes/percentage of votes that went to each candidate

        Identified the winning candidate

    Specifically used write-to-text code for both PyBank and PyPoll, and use for loop structure for PyPoll 
    
Classmate: cohort member Caleb Gould assisted with construction of multiple for loops for PyBank
